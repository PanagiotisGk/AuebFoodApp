# 🍔 Distributed Food Delivery System  
Distributed Systems Course Project – Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), Spring 2025  

---

## 📖 Overview  
A collaborative academic project implementing a distributed online food delivery system using a Master–Worker architecture in Java, with an Android client app for end-users.  
It demonstrates scalable task distribution, real-time analytics, and fault-tolerant communication between distributed nodes.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  
- 🧠 Backend: Developed in Java using multi-threaded Master–Worker architecture  
- 💬 Communication: Real-time data exchange via TCP sockets  
- 🗂️ Processing: MapReduce-inspired aggregation for sales and revenue data  
- 📱 Frontend: Android app for user interactions and order management  
- 💾 Fault Tolerance: Local worker-side persistence for resilience  
- 📊 Analytics: Revenue per product and per product category
